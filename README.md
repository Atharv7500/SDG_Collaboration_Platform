# 🌍 SDG Collaboration & Impact Platform

The **SDG Collaboration & Impact Platform** is a full-stack web application designed to help **Startups, NGOs, Government organizations, and Researchers** collaborate effectively on projects aligned with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

Instead of using multiple tools like emails, spreadsheets, and messaging apps, this platform brings everything together into **one centralized system** for collaboration, communication, and impact tracking.
